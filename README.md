The purpose of this project to identify the causes for movements in covid19 hospital admission activities. We tackled this issue by finding the top 5 London boroughs across different categories and analyzing their collective weekly covid cases per 100,000 people.
By running multilinear regression, we were able to find the following characteristics that have significant connection to hospital admission activities.
large minority population
large old population
high male to female population ratio
low pay

This analysis will help NHS London in properly identifying which London boroughs needed the most funding in combatting both Covid19 and the ongoing backlog that occurred as a result of rising covid19 hospital admission
